### Twitter as an Economic Indicator

Project for Data Mining.

Intends to ingest twitter tweets and predict how sepcifically chosen stocks will act in accordance with the twitter data.
For this project we used 3 node spark/hadoop cluster on GCP 8-vcpus/30 GB RAM per machine. We ingested roughly 300 GB of twitter data in the
spark cluster. Resuted in 70% accuracy, though we had issues with the graphs matching up to the terminally calculated accuracy.
